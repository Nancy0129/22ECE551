Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2 cyoa-step3 cyoa-step4 cyoa-step1.o cyoa-step2.o cyoa-step3.o cyoa-step4.o story.o page.o cyoa.o
g++ -std=gnu++98 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c cyoa-step1.cpp
g++ -o cyoa-step1 cyoa-step1.o
rm cyoa-step1.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 ./Test/emptystory < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Cannot open the story.txt file!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 ./Test/mystory1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


1.3: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 ./nowhere < /dev/null

Your file did not match the expected output



1.12: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 ./Test/bad1_9 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
At "0@N"
The input line has invalid format!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:

rm cyoa-step4.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step4 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 4
------------------------------------


4.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step4 ./Test/emptystory < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Cannot open the story.txt file!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


4.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step4 ./Test/mystory1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
A page reference is not valid!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


4.3: Current test is ./cyoa-step4 ./Test/bad1_8 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
The game is not end!

-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 4

You have NOT passed your test cases!
You should go and figure out/understand where thing went wrong
And fix the problem(s) before the deadline
