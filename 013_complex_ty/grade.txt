Grading at Mon Sep  5 09:24:30 PM EDT 2022
Checking syntax of declarations, and code that uses them
mytypes.c has either illegal, or un-useable declarations
the mostly likely causes are that you
     have the wrong field names/types
  or did not include the typedefs you were supposed to
  or have the wrong values in the enum (missing, mis-spelled, or extras)
  or have a syntax error in your declarations

Overall Grade: FAILED
